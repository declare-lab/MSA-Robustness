# MulT model and Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Benchmarks

This directory contains the model architecture for Multimodal Transformer (MulT) as well as the three major multimodal sentiment analysis benchmarks we used in the paper. All datasets should be put in the `../data` folder (if it does not exist, use `mkdir` to create one). Depending on the dataset, we may have different sets of evaluation metrics (see `eval_metrics.py`).
